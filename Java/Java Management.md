<!-- Java Management.md -->

A Java program is essentially a collection of 1 or more Java files that have classes, `main` functions, and supplementary functions.
Upon executing a particular file, the `main` function will be called. The functionality depends on the other functions that are called within the `main` and the other files that are included for the primary class to reference.

```java
javac <filename>.java // creates a <filename>.class file to be executed
java <filename> // executes the <filename>.class "main" function
```
