### Manage HTTP & HTTPS Pages.

##### General HTTP Information.

HTTP stands for "Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol".<br>
It's how browsers & web servers communicate; it's important to understand if you want to write any kind of web application.<br>
HTTP is a stateless protocol. Every request is different from the last, that's why we need to use Cookies for user sessions.<br>

* **Version 1.1** (the most common) is text-based. This means that you can understand it without any special tools.
* **Version 2.0** is binary based. Binary protocols require special tools to work with but they are more efficient.

### Use HTTP Requests with RoR.

##### Doing something specific.

```sh
# Comment
Code
```

##### Useful HTTP Related RoR Gems.
