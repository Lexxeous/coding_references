### What is Laravel?
**Laravel** is a free, open-source, PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and based on Symfony. Some of the features of **Laravel** are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, with OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
