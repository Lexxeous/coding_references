### Documentation for programming languages and related concepts.

This repository is a collection of documented resources that I have gathered over my time as a programmer. I update and reorganize these files almost constantly as I learn new information. Some conceptual topics included are (but not limited to): `Git`, `Bash`, `HAML`, `JSON`, `Markdown (MD)`, `Redis`, `Regex`, `SQL`, `Ruby`, `Ruby on Rails`, `Javascript (JS)`, `jQuery`, `HTML` & `CSS`. 

Most of the documentation contained within this repository has been aquired from the internet, college courses, internships, online tutorials, and/or tutorial books. I claim no ownership of any code contained within this repository. This repository is simply my interpretation of concepts revealed to me through my professional development.
