### Documentation for programming languages and related concepts.

This repository is a collection of documented resources that I have gathered over my time as a programmer and engineering student. I update and re-organize these files almost constantly as I learn new information. Some conceptual topics and programs included are (but not limited to): `Assembly`, `Bash & Unix`, `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Git`, `HAML & YAML`, `HTML & CSS`, `Javascript (JS) & jQuery`, `Javascript Object Notation (JSON)`, `LaTeX & BibTeX`, `Logisim`, `LTspice`, `MATLAB`, `Markdown (MD)`, `Protocols`, `Python`, `R`, `Redis`, `Regular Expression (Regex)`, `reST`, `Ruby on Rails (RoR)`, `SQL`, `Unity`, `Verilog`, & `VHDL`.

With any empty files or folders, I have simply not moved my current/available resources to the corresponding directory.

Most of the documentation contained within this repository has been acquired from the internet, college courses, internships, online tutorials, and/or tutorial books. I claim no ownership of any code contained within this repository. This repository is simply my interpretation of concepts revealed to me through my professional development.
